Context:
	A Context is what Tomcat calls a web application.
	A Context Descriptor is simply an XML file that contains Tomcat related configuration for a Context, e.g naming resources or session manager configuration. 

Context Descpriptors
	Context Descriptors not only help Tomcat to know how to configure Contexts but other tools such as the Tomcat Manager and TCD often use these Context Descriptors to perform their roles properly.
